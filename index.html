            <b>Gross National Income (GNI)</b> refers to the total amount of money earned by a 
            nation's residents and businesses, including any product or production income received from overseas. 
            It is a broad measure that reflects the economic performance of a country.
            <br><br>
            Recognizing a nation's <b>Per Capita Gross National Income (GNI)</b> is an essential 
            preliminary step in grasping the economic vitality and requirements of a country, 
            as well as discerning the prevalent living standards accessible to its average inhabitant. 
            The GNI per capita of a country usually shares a close connection with various other indicators, 
            systematically reflecting the social, economic, and environmental welfare experienced by the nation 
            and its populace. These correlated indicators collectively offer a broader perspective on the holistic 
            well-being and quality of life within a nation, providing valuable insights into the areas where the 
            country excels or requires improvement. 
            <br><br>
            The <b>Gross National Income (GNI) Per Capita</b> provides valuable insights into the economic health of nations, 
            acting as a reliable indicator of average income levels within countries. Represented on a global scale, 
            this map offers a comparative view of countries based on their GNI per capita, capturing economic disparities 
            and facilitating an understanding of global economic distribution. This visualization spans from 2000 to 2022, 
            enabling a temporal analysis of changes and trends in global economic performance.
            <br><br>
            For a more detailed analysis, we've chosen to investigate further into countries such as 
            <span style="color:#E69F00">United States</span>, 
            <span style="color:#56B4E9">China</span>, 
            <span style="color:#009E73">Japan</span>, 
            <span style="color:#F0E442">Germany</span>, 
            <span style="color:#0072B2">India</span>, 
            <span style="color:#D55E00">United Kingdom</span>, 
            <span style="color:#CC79A7">France</span>, 
            <span style="color:#999999">Brazil</span>, 
            <span style="color:#1F77B4">Italy</span>, and 
            <span style="color:#FF7F0E">Canada</span>.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How to Interact:</strong>
            <br>
            1. <strong>Time Slider (Year Selection):</strong> Located above the map, use the slider to navigate through different 
            years, from 2000 to 2022. As you adjust the slider, the color intensity on the map will change to reflect the GNI per 
            capita values for the selected year.
            <br>
            2. <strong>Hover Over Countries:</strong> Positioning your cursor over a specific country will display a tooltip. 
            This tooltip provides detailed information about the country's name, its income per person (in USD), and the data year. 
            Countries in light grey indicate unavailable data for the selected year.
            <br>
            3. <strong>Color Legend:</strong> The color gradient, ranging from lighter to darker shades, represents GNI per capita 
            values. Darker shades indicate higher GNI per capita, while lighter shades represent lower values. This gradient offers 
            a quick visual comparison between countries.
            <br>
            4. <strong>Graticules:</strong> The white gridlines on the map, known as graticules, provide geographical reference 
            points, assisting in locating countries based on latitude and longitude.

        <div id="g2"></div>
        <p id="sec2_text" class="text">
            <b>Health Expenditure</b> is a crucial indicator reflecting the financial priorities of a nation concerning the health of its populace. The amount of money allocated per person can provide insights into the quality, accessibility, and extent of healthcare services within a country.
            <br><br>
            Monitoring the <b>Health Expenditure Per Capita over time</b> for key economies allows for a comparative analysis. This data can shed light on the effectiveness of healthcare investments, indicate possible health disparities among nations, and provide insights into a country's commitment to the health and well-being of its citizens.
            <br><br>
            From the graph, it's evident that the <span style="color:#E69F00;">United States</span> consistently leads in health expenditure per capita, showing a sustained increase over the years. Meanwhile, countries like <span style="color:#56B4E9;">China</span> and <span style="color:#0072B2;">India</span> began with lower expenditures but exhibit a steady rise, emphasizing their growing investments in healthcare. European nations such as <span style="color:#009E73;">Japan</span>, <span style="color:#F0E442;">Germany</span>, and <span style="color:#D55E00;">United Kingdom</span> maintain a relatively stable health expenditure, reflecting their established healthcare systems. Interestingly, <span style="color:#CC79A7;">France</span> and <span style="color:#1F77B4;">Italy</span> follow similar trends, suggesting possible parallels in their health policies. In the Americas, both <span style="color:#999999;">Brazil</span> and <span style="color:#FF7F0E;">Canada</span> have shown consistent investments in healthcare, with Canada's expenditure being relatively higher.
            <br><br>

        <div id="g3"></div>
        <p id="sec3_text" class="text">
            The <b>Human Capital Index (HCI)</b> provides a holistic view of how countries invest in their most valuable asset: their people. This index quantifies the potential human capital that can be realized by a child born today until the age of 18, considering the prevailing conditions of health and education.
            <br><br>
            Evaluating HCI across key economies underscores the varying levels of emphasis nations place on health and education. A higher index hints at better potential productivity and earnings prospects for the country's future workforce.
            <br><br>
            Among the nations charted, <span style="color:#1F77B4">Canada</span> stands out for its exemplary commitment to human capital, as reflected in its leading HCI scores. An intriguing observation across the board is the marginally higher HCI values for females—denoted in <span style="color:#e74c3c">red</span>—as opposed to males, represented in <span style="color:#3498db">blue</span>. This trend suggests that women might, on average, experience slight advantages in certain areas like health or education in these countries.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How to Interact:</strong>
            <br>
            1. <strong>Year Selection:</strong> Navigate through different years using the dropdown. The HCI representation will adjust according to the selected year, offering a dynamic view of changes over time.
            <br>
            2. <strong>Hover Over Bars:</strong> For detailed insights on a particular country's HCI and a breakdown by gender, simply hover over the corresponding bar.
            <br>
            3. <strong>Color Coding:</strong> Gender distinctions are visually represented by colors: <span style="color:#5DADE2">blue</span> for males and <span style="color:#e74c3c">red</span> for females. This contrast aids in discerning potential disparities in HCI values between the two genders.
